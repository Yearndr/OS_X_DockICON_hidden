# OS_X_DockICON_hidden
This script can hide the icons of some applications in the OS X Dock that only need to run in the background [such as some music that has icons in the notification bar, emails, etc.] or icons of applications that you don't want to see. [For example, the icon is too ugly lol]. This script can do it for you.
